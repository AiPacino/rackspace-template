# WARNING: this (user/group setting) is a kludge:
# The User/Group for httpd need to be set before we can load mod_fastcgi,
# but /etc/httpd/conf.d/fastcgi.conf on RHEL gets loaded before
# /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, so we need to set them here :(
# mod_fcgid does not have this bug,
# but it does not handle child PHP processes appropriately per
# http://serverfault.com/questions/303535/a-single-php-fastcgi-process-blocks-all-other-php-requests/305093#305093
